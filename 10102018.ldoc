Hello!

Let's get started.

6.33: grep

We fucked this up last time. I don't want that to happen again.

./configure --prefix=/usr --bindir=/bin
make
make -k check
make install

I had some fails. I hope they are not vital.

I am going to check that everything is where I expect it with

ls /bin | grep grep

egrep, fgrep and grep are all in place c:

done!
