let's continue!

#13: Bison

This package contains a parser generator.
Configure with prefix /tools, make, make check, and make install.

#14: Bzip

This one has no configure script. We can compile and test with make, then

                     make PREFIX=/tools install

#15: Coreutils

This package has utilities for showing and setting system characteristics. In order to configure it, we will do

            ./configure --prefix=/tools --enable-install-program=hostname

This will allow the hostname binary to be built and installed. This is required by Perl's test suite.

Once this step is complete, we can say make, make check ( with option RUN_EXPENSIVE_TESTS=yes as desired ) and then make install.



#16: Diffutils

This allows us to show the differences between files and directories.
This one is easy: Configure with prefix tools, make, make check, and make install.

#17: File

This allows us to determine the type of a given file or files!

Configure with prefix /tools, make, make check, and make install.
