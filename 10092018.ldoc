Hello friends!

Some tips:

If you get [ no tty available ... etc ]
Try restarting your machine.

If you get [ /mnt/lfs/dev/pts ], it is because you didn't run

mount -v --bind /dev /mnt/lfs/dev 

before you tried mounting devpts.

I have added scripts for the restart process. They are run in this order:

1. mount
2. VKFS
3. chroot

Good! Let's move on.

= 6.25 ATTR =

This contains utilities to administer attributes on filesystem objects. ( lolwhat? )

Let's configure:

./configure --prefix=/usr --bindir=/bin --disable-static --sysconfdir=/etc --docdir=/usr/share/doc/attr-2.4.48

Now,

make
make check
make install

Nice! The shared library must be moved to lib. Then, recreate the so file in /usr/lib.

	mv -v /usr/lib/libattr.so.* /lib
	ln -sfv ../../lib/$(readlink /usr/lib/libattr.so) /usr/lib/libattr.so

Done!

= 6.26: ACL =

This lets us administer access control lists. It is probably very important.

Let's configure:

./configure --prefix=/usr --bindir=/bin --disable-static --libexecdir=/usr/lib --libexecdir=/usr/lib --docdir=/usr/share/doc/acl-2.2.53

If you get an error in regards to not having an extended attributes library, try 

	rm -rvf /usr/lib/libattr*
	rm -rvf /lib/libattr*

and then building attr over again.

Next,
make
make install
Like in attr, we need to move shared libraries and make symlinks

	mv -v /usr/lib/libacl.so.* /lib
	ln -sfv ../../lib/$(readlink /usr/lib/libacl.so) /usr/lib/libacl.so

Done

= 6.27: Libcap =

Lol what the fuck

This package implements user-space interfaces to POSIX capabilities available in linux kernels
It helps partition root privelege into different sets.

prevent a static library from being installed:

sed -i '/install*STALIBNAME/d' libcap/Makefile

Next,

make

When installing, stop it from using setcap on itself.
Also, prevent it from using lib64; instead use lib.

make RAISE_SETFCAP=no lib=lib prefix=/usr install
Then,
chmod -v 755 /usr/lib/libcap.so

Like the previous two, move the shared libraries:
mv -v /usr/lib/libcap.so.* /lib
ln -sfv ../../lib/$(readlink /usr/lib/libcap.so) /usr/lib/libcap.so

Done!
