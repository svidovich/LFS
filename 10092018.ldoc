Hello friends!

Some tips:

If you get [ no tty available ... etc ]
Try restarting your machine.

If you get [ /mnt/lfs/dev/pts ], it is because you didn't run

mount -v --bind /dev /mnt/lfs/dev 

before you tried mounting devpts.

I have added scripts for the restart process. They are run in this order:

1. mount
2. VKFS
3. chroot

Good! Let's move on.
