#24: Make

This one is weird. I am going to make make.
First, fix an error caused by glibc ( THANKS GLIBC )

	sed -i '211,217 d; 219,229 d; 232 d' glob/glob.c

To configure, issue

	./configure --prefix=/tools --without-guile

Guile may be available on host, but won't be in the chroot environment. Skip em.

#25: Patch

This allows us to modify / craete files by applying a patch created by diff.
Business as usual here!
