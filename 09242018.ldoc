We are moving on to chapter 4 today. We have all of the packages... around.
We are going to create a directory for temporary tools, and add a user! We will
construct an environment for the use to play in.

In order to create the temp directory, run these as root:

	mkdir -v $LFS/tools
	ln -sv $LFS/tools /

This symlink makes it so our toolchain is compiled so that it always refers to /tools. Thus
when we decouple the OS, things will still work.
