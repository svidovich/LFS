Today we will be making the partition on which LFS will be store

=====
notes
=====

> EXT4 is rad because it has speed improvements, can handle really big files, and can make timestamps on the level of the very small. Rad!

> Never forget to do export LFS=/mnt/lfs -- this will ensure that we can work in that directory until we unhook the os
>> In order to mount lfs properly, we did the following:
	sudo -i
	mkdir -p /mnt/lfs
	mount /dev/sdb1 /mnt/lfs
